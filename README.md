A Shiny app to showcase and learn some of the basic functionalities of the package [ggraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/index.html) for network visualization, created in collaboration with [Rachel Longjohn](https://github.com/rlongjohn) and [Wendy Rummerfield](https://github.com/wendyrummer13).
